I am a Sophomore studying computer engineering at the [University of California, Santa Barbara.](https://www.ucsb.edu/)

### Courses

Data Structures and Algorithms. (instructed in C++)

Object Oriented Design and Implementation. (instructed in C++)

Foundations of Analog and Digital Circuits and Systems.

I have academic experience in C++ and Java while learning Python and HTML independently.

### Work Experience

I interned at a company named [Trina Solar](https://www.trinasolar.com/us) in the summer of 2022. I handled data entry as well as managed weekly presentations. Trina was my introduction to work culture and taught me work etiquette.

Currently, I am working part-time at UCSB as a [Facility Services Operator](https://conferences.ucsb.edu/student-employment). This position has developed my interpersonal and time management skills.

### Projects

I have completed a Pingpong Ball Launcher Project in my ECE 5 class. Collaborating with my teammates, I used Solidworks to design and 3-D print a turret that launches pingpong balls. We operated it with a PS4 controller remotely through Arduino with C++ code.

During my internship at Trina, I started a project to automate weekly presentations. I used Python to fetch elements and screenshots from websites using XPath and the Selenium library. Then, the program automatically compiled them into a presentation using the Python pptx and Pillow libraries.

This quarter, I  have finished my Conrad's Game of Life project. This is my personal project which used java to implement Conrad's game of life and the Java AWT library for the user interface.

I have more undergoing projects. I plan to work with Unity on an introductory project this coming school quarter and complete a PCB ornament project within the year under the supervision of an [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/) member.
