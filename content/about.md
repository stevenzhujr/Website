I am a Sophomore studying computer engineering at [University of California, Santa Barbara.](https://www.ucsb.edu/)

### Classes

Data Structures and Algorithms. (instructed in C++)

Object Oriented Design and Implementation. (instructed in C++)

Foundations of Analog and Digital Circuits and Systems.

I have academic experience in C++ and Java, while learning Python and HTML on my own.

### Work Experience

I interned at a company named [Trina Solar](https://www.trinasolar.com/us) during the last summer of highschool. I handeled data entry as well as managed weekly presentations. This was my introduction to work culture.

Now I am working part time at UCSB as a [Facility Services Operator](https://conferences.ucsb.edu/student-employment). This position has greatly developed my interpersonal and time management skills.

### Projects

I have completed a Pingpong Ball Launcher Project in my ECE 5 class. With the aid of my teammates, I used Solidworks to design and 3-D print a turret that launched pingpong balls. We controlled it with a PS4 controller remote through arduino with c++ code.

During my internship at Trina, I started a project to automate weekly presentations. I used python to fetch elements and screenshots from websites using XPath and the Selenium library. Then the program automatically compiled them into a presentation usint the python pptx and Pillow libraries.

I have more projects in the works. I plan to code Conrad's game of life in this coming school quarter and complete a PCB ornament project this school year under the supervision of [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/).
