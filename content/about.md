I am a fourth year computer engineering student studying at the [University of California, Santa Barbara.](https://www.ucsb.edu/)

### Work Experience
I interned at Northrop Grumman as a system engineer during the summer of 2025. As my first technical role, it greatly deepened my understanding as a system engineer. To learn more about it, [click here.](/experiences/ng)

I am a member of [OCAQ II](https://ocaqpi.ece.ucsb.edu/) as part of Professor Daniel Blumenthal's lab at UCSB. My current project involves measuring the quality factor and dispersion of various photonic integrated devices and designing photonic chips using gdsfactory and KLayout.

I am also working part-time at UCSB as a [Facility Services Operator](https://conferences.ucsb.edu/student-employment), where I have developed strong interpersonal and time management skills.

### Courses

- Data Structures and Algorithms. (C++)

- Object Oriented Design and Implementation. (C++)

- Foundations of Analog and Digital Circuits and Systems.

- Introduction to Deep Learning (Python)

- Operating systems (C)

- Analog and Digital Circuits and Systems

- Sensor and Peripheral Design (Verilog)

### Projects

- Pingpong Ball Launcher: In my ECE 5 class, I collaborated with teammates to design and 3D print a turret using SolidWorks. The turret is operated remotely via a PS4 controller and Arduino with C++ code.

- Automation of Weekly Presentations: During my internship at Trina Solar, I developed a Python script using Selenium and XPath to fetch web content, compile screenshots, and generate presentations with Python pptx and Pillow libraries.

- Conrad's Game of Life: This personal project involved implementing Conrad's Game of Life in Java, with a user interface built using the Java AWT library.

- IEEE Projects: As an active member of IEEE, I have completed various projects, including a PCB ornament and a flip-flop clock.

I have several ongoing projects but am currently prioritizing my research in the Blumenthal lab. As a side project, I plan to explore Unity for an introductory project in the upcoming school year.
