I am a Junior studying computer engineering at the [University of California, Santa Barbara.](https://www.ucsb.edu/)

### Courses

- Data Structures and Algorithms. (instructed in C++)

- Object Oriented Design and Implementation. (instructed in C++)

- Foundations of Analog and Digital Circuits and Systems.

- Introduction to Deep Learning (instructed in Python)

### Languages

I have academic experience in C++ and Java while learning Python and HTML independently through projects.

### Work Experience

I am a member of [OCAQ II](https://ocaqpi.ece.ucsb.edu/) as part of professor Daniel Blumenthal's lab at UCSB. My current project involves taking measurements of the quality factor and dispersion of various photonic integrated devices and designing photonic chips through the use of gdsfactory and klayout.

I am also working part-time at UCSB as a [Facility Services Operator](https://conferences.ucsb.edu/student-employment). This position has developed my interpersonal and time management skills.

Previously, I interned at a company named [Trina Solar](https://www.trinasolar.com/us) in the summer of 2022. I handled data entry as well as managed weekly presentations. Trina was my introduction to work culture and taught me work etiquette.

### Projects

I have completed a Pingpong Ball Launcher Project in my ECE 5 class. Collaborating with my teammates, I used Solidworks to design and 3-D print a turret that launches pingpong balls. We operated it with a PS4 controller remotely through Arduino with C++ code.

During my internship at Trina, I started a project to automate weekly presentations. I used Python to fetch elements and screenshots from websites using XPath and the Selenium library. Then, the program automatically compiled them into a presentation using the Python pptx and Pillow libraries.

I  have finished my Conrad's Game of Life project. This is my personal project which used java to implement Conrad's game of life and the Java AWT library for the user interface.

As a member of [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/), I have completed various projects including a PCB ornament and a flipflop clock.

I have more undergoing projects but I plan to focus on my research at the Blumenthal lab first and foremost. As a side project, I plan to work with Unity on an introductory project this coming school year.
