I am a Junior studying computer engineering at the [University of California, Santa Barbara.](https://www.ucsb.edu/)

### Courses

- Data Structures and Algorithms. (C++)

- Object Oriented Design and Implementation. (C++)

- Foundations of Analog and Digital Circuits and Systems.

- Introduction to Deep Learning (Python)

### Languages

I have academic experience in C++ and Java and have independently learned Python and HTML through personal projects.

### Work Experience

I am a member of [OCAQ II](https://ocaqpi.ece.ucsb.edu/) as part of Professor Daniel Blumenthal's lab at UCSB. My current project involves measuring the quality factor and dispersion of various photonic integrated devices and designing photonic chips using gdsfactory and KLayout.

I am also working part-time at UCSB as a [Facility Services Operator](https://conferences.ucsb.edu/student-employment), where I have developed strong interpersonal and time management skills.

Previously, I interned at a company named [Trina Solar](https://www.trinasolar.com/us) during the summer of 2022. In this role, I handled data entry and managed weekly presentations, providing me with my first exposure to professional work culture and workplace etiquette.

### Projects

- Pingpong Ball Launcher: In my ECE 5 class, I collaborated with teammates to design and 3D print a turret using SolidWorks. The turret is operated remotely via a PS4 controller and Arduino with C++ code.

- Automation of Weekly Presentations: During my internship at Trina Solar, I developed a Python script using Selenium and XPath to fetch web content, compile screenshots, and generate presentations with Python pptx and Pillow libraries.

- Conrad's Game of Life: This personal project involved implementing Conrad's Game of Life in Java, with a user interface built using the Java AWT library.

- IEEE Projects: As an active member of IEEE, I have completed various projects, including a PCB ornament and a flip-flop clock.

I have several ongoing projects but am currently prioritizing my research in the Blumenthal lab. As a side project, I plan to explore Unity for an introductory project in the upcoming school year.
