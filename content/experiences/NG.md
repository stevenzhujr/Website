### Job Description

For 10 weeks in the summer of 2025, I interned at Northrop Grumman as a System Engineer.

### Responsibilities

In this internship, my main responsibilities included:
- Create a simulation as part of a link budget for a laser-comm project
- Assist other system engineers
- Participate in any and all required project closure operations

### Projects

**False Alarm Rate and Path Analysis**

For the laser-comm projec I was assignedt to, my original task was to analyse the false alarm rate during pointing and acquisition of the initial scan. After creating a graphical tool that streamlined the evaluation and visualization of confidence intervals for data analysis with *desmos* and localizing it. I determined that the analysis was computationally infeasible, but was able to use this experience to pivot into a comprehensive path analysis with this experience.

I first combined several hardware simulation models for a comprehensive path analysis model. Then I developed automated testing workflows for *MATLAB Simulink* models on an *LSF-based computer cluster*, enabling  transmitter side communication scan path analysis and large scale passive data acquisition. I acquired and treated data on acquisition time and probability for the working scan path and generalized the model for any arbitrary path. I presented the findings and documented all relavant details to the project.

**FPA testing**

For the laser-comm projec I was assigned to, I participated in Focal Plane Array and gained experience in test rack automation for optical and electrical system validation. With my assisstance; our team completed testing and obtained significant data before project closure.

**Cameo Reorganization**

I reorganized and created detailed Block Definition Diagrams (BDDs) and Internal Block Diagrams (IBDs) in *Cameo* to improve system architecture clarity and scalability. Due to a project closure, the focus of this project was to clarify the structure and procedure for transforming scattered diagrams into a cohesive single source of truth. We focused on defining how different types of diagram can be related and organized. We were able to refactor a few diagrams as susbstantial examples for guding future legacy projects.

**Communication Studies**

I briefly studied an familiarized myself with an object oriented *MATLAB* simulation tool for satellite communication. It introduced me to the concepts of Bit Error Rates (BER), Packet Error Rates (PER), phase correction, bit and packet error recovery algorithms, Eb/N0 and other basic communication concepts. I used the *DVB-S2/S2X* protocol as a basic case study and was able to use existing code to generate some BER vs. Eb/N0 data with the protocol.

### Take away
Overall this internship taught me a great deal. From broadly introducing me to the work system engineers did, to giving me an opportunit to study communication protocols and simulations. I was able to become much more profficient in MATLAB and deepen my understanding of Model Based System Engineering. (MBSE) I also developed my skills in industry standard tools such as DOORS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Exceed TurboX and more. As well as sharpened my interpersonal and persentational skills.
