### Job Description

I am currently a researcher in Professor Blumenthal's [Optical Communications and Atomic Quantum Photonic Integration Group](https://ocaqpi.ece.ucsb.edu/) at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

### Responsibilities

Some of the things I did in this lab include:
- Utilizing gdsfactory, a Python library, to design photonic chips
- Analyzing data to evaluate the performances of optical devices
- Planning and coordinating testing efforts with research group members
- Gauging the quality factor of optical frequency combs

### Take away

This research experience has significantly enhanced my technical skills in photonics and data analysis, deepened my understanding of optical communications, and honed my ability to work collaboratively in a research team. It has also provided me with hands-on experience in designing and testing cutting-edge photonic devices, preparing me for future challenges in the field.

In a broader sense, this experience has taught me the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and continuous learning in tackling complex scientific challenges. It has allowed me to apply my hardware and software design skills practically. This opportunity has prepared me to approach future projects with a holistic perspective and a strong foundation in both technical and research skills.
