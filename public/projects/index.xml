      <description>The Ping pong Rapid Defence Turret Repeater(PRDTR), is a ping pong ball launcher that was the subject of my ECE 5 course. Me and two other classmates, Vihan Jayaraman, and Jerry Wang, created this as our final project.

We mounted a ping-pong ball launcher on a tiltable mount, giving it 360 degrees of coverage as well as the ability to change the angle of aim.</description>

      <description>This weekly slides updating program was made by me during my internship at Trina. It was mainly used for weekly usage during the internship. However, I am now looking to add an email component to the program, both for crawling for new links (some links are updated monthly and are tracked down by my coworker), as well as automating sending an updated slide to them.
