<p><strong>False Alarm Rate and Path Analysis</strong></p>
<p>For the laser-comm projec I was assignedt to, my original task was to analyse the false alarm rate during pointing and acquisition of the initial scan. After creating a graphical tool that streamlined the evaluation and visualization of confidence intervals for data analysis with <em>desmos</em> and localizing it. I determined that the analysis was computationally infeasible, but was able to use this experience to pivot into a comprehensive path analysis with this experience.</p>
<p>I first combined several hardware simulation models for a comprehensive path analysis model. Then I developed automated testing workflows for <em>MATLAB Simulink</em> models on an <em>LSF-based computer cluster</em>, enabling  transmitter side communication scan path analysis and large scale passive data acquisition. I acquired and treated data on acquisition time and probability for the working scan path and generalized the model for any arbitrary path. I presented the findings and documented all relavant details to the project.</p>
<p><strong>FPA testing</strong></p>
<p>For the laser-comm projec I was assigned to, I participated in Focal Plane Array and gained experience in test rack automation for optical and electrical system validation. With my assisstance; our team completed testing and obtained significant data before project closure.</p>
<p><strong>Cameo Reorganization</strong></p>
<p>I reorganized and created detailed Block Definition Diagrams (BDDs) and Internal Block Diagrams (IBDs) in <em>Cameo</em> to improve system architecture clarity and scalability. Due to a project closure, the focus of this project was to clarify the structure and procedure for transforming scattered diagrams into a cohesive single source of truth. We focused on defining how different types of diagram can be related and organized. We were able to refactor a few diagrams as susbstantial examples for guding future legacy projects.</p>
<p><strong>Communication Studies</strong></p>
<p>I briefly studied an familiarized myself with an object oriented <em>MATLAB</em> simulation tool for satellite communication. It introduced me to the concepts of Bit Error Rates (BER), Packet Error Rates (PER), phase correction, bit and packet error recovery algorithms, Eb/N0 and other basic communication concepts. I used the <em>DVB-S2/S2X</em> protocol as a basic case study and was able to use existing code to generate some BER vs. Eb/N0 data with the protocol.</p>

</h3>
<p>Overall this internship taught me a great deal. From broadly introducing me to the work system engineers did, to giving me an opportunit to study communication protocols and simulations. I was able to become much more profficient in MATLAB and deepen my understanding of Model Based System Engineering. (MBSE) I also developed my skills in industry standard tools such as DOORS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Exceed TurboX and more. As well as sharpened my interpersonal and persentational skills.</p>
