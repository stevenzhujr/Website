    <p>I am a Sophomore studying computer engineering at <a href="https://www.ucsb.edu/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of California, Santa Barbara.</a></p>
<p>During the last summer of highschool, I interned at a company named <a href="https://www.trinasolar.com/us"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trina Solar</a>. This opportunity was my introduction to work culture. My task included data entry and to lead presentations within the company. Currently, I am working part time at UCSB as a <a href="https://conferences.ucsb.edu/student-employment"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facility Services Operator</a>. I was trained in elementary operations with audio and video equipment, as well as furthered my skill in interpersonal communication and scheduling.</p>
<p>Computer engineering involves both software and hardware. For hardware, I have general skills in circuitry, digital logic, and electrical engineering. I have completed a ping pong ball launcher as a project from my ECE 5 class and am aiming to work on a project involving in PCB making as part of <a href="https://www.ieee.org/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IEEE</a>.</p>
<p>In terms of software, I know Java, C++, python, html and more, though currently I am most comfortable with C++ and python. I learned python on my own for its versitility, and I was taught in C++ during classes.</p>
<p>From the Trina internship, I started two projects, one regarding data analysis for KPI from excel using macros and one written in python for fetching elements from the web for a weekly presentation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the data analysis project was terminated when the employee I was collaborating with left the company after I finished my internship. However, you can check out my weekly presentations project and all the other projects I&rsquo;ve mentioned on my <a href="/projects" >Projects page.</a></p>
